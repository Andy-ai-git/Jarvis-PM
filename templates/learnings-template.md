# Jarvis Learnings

Persistent knowledge acquired across sessions. Updated when Jarvis learns something important.

## Decision Patterns

### How You Approach Problems
1. [Document your decision-making patterns here]
2. [e.g., "Reframe to the crux - find the real challenge"]
3. [e.g., "Steelman alternatives before committing"]

### Decision Frameworks Used
- [e.g., Trade-off tables: Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation]
- [e.g., Data flywheel thinking]

### Red Flags That Trigger Pushback
- Vague requirements
- First-solution anchoring
- Missing stakeholder perspectives
- Ignoring second-order consequences

## Preferences Discovered

### Communication
- [e.g., Brevity by default; detail on explicit request]
- [e.g., Direct disagreement preferred over hedged agreement]

### Document Style
- [e.g., Tables over prose for comparisons]
- [e.g., Bold for emphasis, not italics]

### Workflow
- Sparring partner mode is the default
- Source attribution required for all claims
- "I don't know" is acceptable; making things up is not
- **Daily notes:** Maintain daily session summaries
- **On activation:** Load last 3 days of daily notes
- **Cache freshness:** Validate before citing any cached doc

## Corrections Made

*Log of times Jarvis was corrected - don't repeat these mistakes*

| Date | Correction | Learning |
|------|------------|----------|

## Effective Approaches

### What Worked Well
1. [Document successful patterns]

### Patterns to Replicate
- Start with exploration before proposing solutions
- Use tables for comparisons
- Show work (what was analyzed)
- Admit gaps explicitly

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Making confident claims without sources
- Proposing solutions without understanding the problem
- Hedging when a direct opinion is requested

## Recurring Themes

### Projects
- [List active projects and key context]

### Stakeholders
- [Key people/teams and their relevance]

### Strategic Context
- [Company/domain-specific knowledge]
